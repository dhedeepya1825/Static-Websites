# Static-Websites
This repository contains all the files for static websites I have created using HTML, CSS &amp;  Bootstrap. These websites demonstrate responsive design principles, visually appealing layouts, and user-friendly interfaces. The repository serves as a portfolio of my web development projects and can be used to showcase or share static web content.
